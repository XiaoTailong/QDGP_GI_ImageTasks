# QDGP_GI_ImageTasks
The repository is the implementation of QDGP for ghost imaging and typical image tasks. Partial of the code is borrowed from DGP implementation [https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch](https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch) and [https://github.com/XingangPan/deep-generative-prior](https://github.com/XingangPan/deep-generative-prior)

# Quantum Implementation
The inplementation of quantum neural networks is based on tensorcircuit, which supports hybrid quantum-classical quantum machine learning tasks. The code can be executed on GPU devices.
